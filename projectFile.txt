1.Initialize the Project:

1.Created a new project directory.
Initialized a new Node.js project using npm init.
Created a .env file to store environment variables.




2.Installed necessary dependencies using npm install:
bcrypt
cookie-parser
dotenv
express
express-validator
jsonwebtoken
mongoose
morgan





Setup Configuration:

3.Created a configuration file config.js to load environment variables and freeze the configuration object.



Setup Server:

4.In config.js file You are loading environment variables using dotenv, storing them in a frozen config object, and exporting it to ensure consistent and secure access to configuration values across your application.

Created a server file server.js to initialize the Express app, create an HTTP server, and connect to the MongoDB database.





Setup Express App:

5.Created an Express app in app.js with middleware for logging, parsing JSON, URL-encoded data, and cookies.
Set up routing for user-related endpoints.




Setup Database Connection:

6.Created a database connection file db.js to connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.




Create User Model:

7.Created a user model in user.js with schema definitions and methods for password hashing, comparison, and token generation with using userSchema static and methods function

*note:Think of statics as functions for all users (User model) and methods as functions for one user (user instance).
statics → Used for model-level functions (called on the model).
Example: User.findByEmail(email) → Find a user by email.

methods → Used for instance-level functions (called on a document).
Example: user.getFullName() → Get full name of a specific user.




Create User Controller:

8.Created a user controller in user.controller.js with a function to handle user registration.
Setup User Routes:



9.Created user routes in user.routes.js to handle user registration with validation using express-validator.
install express-validation and `import {body} from express-validator` "In body we get data that user submit it"

then write validation code where we write a code of middleware 


*note:.isString({ lowercase: true }) this well not work so we want use
 ".costom((value)=> value === value.toLowerCase) "

10.now when get error message (example: username must be a string ) that can be That can be received on the controller.js file For accessing the message we want to import validateresult from express-validator 


11.create middleware folder in it create user.middleware.js file for validateresult code for simiply the code base god best look more readable



creating a user
12.for this we want to make service folder to code for user creation and call in user.controller file by do this controller look more readable

IN userService.js file we want create user first of all create function name createuser in that function add some 
condition whether user enter the (username, email, password) and also Check whether user is existent or not if existed then it will show error otherwise register user 

then create a hashedpassword with using static function we make in userModel simiply call it 

then create user with hashedpassword and save it and 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*delete user._doc.password // This line is used to delete the password from the user object, so it is not sent to the frontend
Why is this necessary?
Security

User passwords should never be exposed in API responses, even if they are hashed.
If sent, an attacker might exploit it, increasing security risks.
Frontend doesn't need it

The password is only needed for authentication and should not be stored or displayed in the frontend.
Prevents data leaks

Avoids accidental exposure in logs, browser storage, or API responses.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 and then return user  

Now in userController.js file import userService.js file create a user using
 userService.createUser (createUser functin come from userService.js) 
 then create token 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*note*
 The reason we are creating the user inside the service file (userService.js) but still calling it inside the controller file (userController.js)?
 =>
* Service (userService.js): Handles business logic (e.g., checking if the user exists, hashing passwords, and saving data).

* Controller (userController.js): Handles HTTP requests and responses, calling the service to perform actions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


create a function loginUserController in that you should check user validationResult from import { validateresult } from express-validation then call the function loginUser that has been create in userService



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Now to show user profile first all you want create isLoggin middleware using redis.io

Q.why we use redis.io?
=>Redis is an in-memory data store, meaning that data is stored in RAM instead of on a disk. This results in extremely fast read and write operations, making it ideal for tracking session data like user login status in real time.


setup redis and get redis_host,redis_port and redis_password  from redis after geting set in env file then in config file 
now make in services folder create redis.service.js file
create new redis and pass all credensial in it and after that connect the redis


Now create a authUser middleware for to get token data and set in redis 

if user not found find in mongodb then set redis







console.log(req.tokenData) => {
  token: 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJfaWQiOiI2N2FiMjk1NTExODU5YmU4MDNiZWRkYzkiLCJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InRlc3QyIiwiZW1haWwiOiJ0ZXN0MkB0ZXN0LmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTczOTM2MTA3MiwiZXhwIjoxNzM5NDQ3NDcyfQ.Wa0ecFTOc30AX2g7gmmN1qLu1ah-6VUfAM8Jr0Ci3WA',
